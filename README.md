This Python script sorts all files in a folder by their extensions into new folders named after each extension, followed by 'Files'. 
To use this script, download the code and create a new Python file to run it. 
You can then import the script and specify the folder you want to organize:

from file_organizer import organizer
organizer("path/to/your/folder")

**DISCLAIMER**: This operation cannot be undone, so please **TRIPLE CHECK** your file path before running the script!"
